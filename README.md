# Ackee Frontend Cookbook

If you came here for some Ackee and salt fish recipes then we have bad news for you. We cook mobile & web apps and this Cookbook is about cooking the best apps with Prague based company Ackee.

However if you really want some Ackee and saltfish instead of javascript [here are some recipes](https://cookpad.com/us/search/ackee) for you. üë®‚Äçüç≥

## Why another javascript practices / style guide?

There could be many similar cookbooks but this one is ours and we want to share for several reasons:

- We hire a lot! So you know what you can expect joining us
- We think we do some pretty cool stuff and we want to share it with you
- Sharing is caring
- Besides who wouldn‚Äôt like to have own cookbook on the internet right?
